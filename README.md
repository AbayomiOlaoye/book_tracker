# Book Tracker App
A book inventory app aimed to maintain book history. Books can be easily added with all of its objects (characteristic information): title and author(s).
You can also remove books at anytime with just a click!

Books get added dynamically just like putting a book on a book rack.
As I progress, the app will be styled using SASS, make use of local storage so that users get to store and really have access to their logged entries, and to introduce some navigation elements for smooth user experience.
